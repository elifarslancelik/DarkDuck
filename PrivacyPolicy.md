Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding user privacy when you use the DarkDuck Safari web extension (the "Service").
Please note that DarkDuck operates locally on your device and does not collect, use, or disclose any of your personal information.

Definitions
Application: Refers to the DarkDuck Safari web extension, the software program provided by the Developer.
Developer: Refers to Elif ArslanÃ§elik ("the Developer", "We", "Us" or "Our").
Device: Any Apple device that can utilize the Safari web extension.
Personal Data: Any information related to an identified or identifiable individual.
Please be aware that DarkDuck does not collect any Personal Data.
Service: Refers to the DarkDuck Safari web extension.
You: The individual accessing or using the Service.
No Collection of Your Personal Data
DarkDuck does not collect any personal data from its users. The extension operates entirely on your local device. This means:

We do not ask you to provide any personally identifiable information such as your name or email address.
We do not track your usage data such as IP address, browsing history, or device identifiers.
We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies to collect information.
How the Service Works
DarkDuck is a Safari web extension that runs locally to apply dark mode to the websites you visit. It automatically detects your system theme setting (light or dark mode) and formats web pages accordingly.
This detection is handled entirely on your device and is never shared with any external server.

Third-Party Links
DarkDuck interacts with the websites you visit in your Safari browser.
Please note that these third-party websites have their own privacy policies, and we have no control over or responsibility for their content or practices.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.
Since DarkDuck does not collect any user data, these updates will primarily reflect operational changes or legal requirements related to the extensionâ€™s distribution.
Changes take effect when posted on this page.
